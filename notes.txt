If object is passed by function by 'pass by value', constructor of that object and copy constructor will be called. Be careful!

When is user defined copy constructor needed?

If we donâ€™t define our own copy constructor, the C++ compiler creates a default copy constructor
for each class which does a member wise copy between objects. The compiler created copy constructor
works fine in general. We need to define our own copy constructor only if an object has pointers or
any run time allocation of resource like file handle, a network connection..etc.
